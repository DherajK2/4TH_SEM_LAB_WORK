# Wildcards in Linux (Filename Pattern Matching)

Wildcards are used to match files using patterns instead of exact names. They are often used with `ls`, `rm`, `cp`, and other file-handling commands.

## ðŸ”§ Step 1: Create Sample Files

Run the following to set up all the example files:

```bash
# Files for simple patterns
touch cat cap cad car cup cat1 cow city

# Files with vowel in the middle
touch cet cit cot cut

# Files with capital letters and digits
touch A1 B2 C3 D4 Z9

# Files with extensions
touch hello.txt bye.txt add.py test1.txt test2.py test3.md cap1.txt cap2.py

# Files for fa pattern
touch fa1 fa2 fa3
```
