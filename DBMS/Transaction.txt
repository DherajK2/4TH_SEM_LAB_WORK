Explain different transaction States. Write an SQL command to set
the transaction isolation level to Read Committed

ChatGPT said:
Sure! Let's break this into two parts:

âœ… 1. Transaction States in SQL
A transaction is a logical unit of work that must be completed fully or not at all. SQL transactions go through the following states:

State	Description
Active	The transaction has started and operations are being performed.
Partially Committed	All statements have been executed, but changes are not yet permanent (waiting for commit).
Committed	All changes made by the transaction are saved permanently to the database.
Failed	An error occurs, and the transaction cannot proceed.
Aborted	The transaction is rolled back (undone) due to failure or a manual rollback.

START TRANSACTION
     â†“
ACTIVE â†’ PARTIALLY COMMITTED
     â†“
 COMMIT (â†’ COMMITTED) OR ROLLBACK (â†’ ABORTED)
âœ… 2. SQL Command to Set Isolation Level to READ COMMITTED
sql
Copy
Edit
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;
ðŸ§  What It Means:
Read Committed ensures a transaction can only read data that has been committed by other transactions.

Prevents dirty reads (i.e., reading uncommitted changes from others).

It's a common default in databases like SQL Server and Oracle.

âœ… Example in a Transaction Block:
sql
Copy
Edit
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;

START TRANSACTION;

-- Your SQL operations here

COMMIT;
