```
Consider a database managing customer information with two tables:
â€˜Customerâ€™ and â€˜CustomerUpdateLogâ€™.
Customer (CustomerID, Name, Email, Phone)
CustomerUpdateLog (LogID, CustomerID, LogMessage, LogDate)
Write SQL queries for the following:
```

### i) Create the tables with suitable datatypes and constraints
```sql
-- Customer Table
CREATE TABLE Customer (
    CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    Email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    Phone VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL
);

-- CustomerUpdateLog Table
CREATE TABLE CustomerUpdateLog (
    LogID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    CustomerID INT NOT NULL,
    LogMessage TEXT NOT NULL,
    LogDate TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customer(CustomerID)
);


```


### ii) Create a trigger that logs updates in CustomerUpdateLog
```sql

DELIMITER $$

CREATE TRIGGER trg_customer_update
AFTER UPDATE ON Customer
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO CustomerUpdateLog (CustomerID, LogMessage)
    VALUES (
        NEW.CustomerID,
        CONCAT(
            'Customer updated. Name: ', OLD.Name, ' â†’ ', NEW.Name,
            ', Email: ', OLD.Email, ' â†’ ', NEW.Email,
            ', Phone: ', OLD.Phone, ' â†’ ', NEW.Phone
        )
    );
END$$

DELIMITER ;

---

## write a SQL query to create a view named â€˜BookDetailsâ€™ that combines information from the â€˜Bookâ€™, â€˜Authorâ€™, and â€˜Publisherâ€™ tables:
```sql
CREATE VIEW BookDetails AS
SELECT 
    B.BookID,
    B.Title,
    A.Name AS AuthorName,
    P.Name AS PublisherName,
    B.Price
FROM 
    Book B
JOIN 
    Author A ON B.AuthorID = A.AuthorID
JOIN 
    Publisher P ON B.PublisherID = P.PublisherID;

```
