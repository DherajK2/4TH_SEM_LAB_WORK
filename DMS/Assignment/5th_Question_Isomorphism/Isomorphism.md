## 5) Isomorphism: Definition and Applications

### a) Definition of Isomorphism in Graphs and Data Structures

**Isomorphism** between two objects, such as graphs or data structures, means that there exists a **one-to-one mapping** between their elements that preserves the structure and relationships.

#### For Graphs:
- Two graphs \( G_1 = (V_1, E_1) \) and \( G_2 = (V_2, E_2) \) are **isomorphic** if there exists a bijection \( f: V_1 \to V_2 \) such that any two vertices \( u \) and \( v \) are adjacent in \( G_1 \) if and only if \( f(u) \) and \( f(v) \) are adjacent in \( G_2 \).
- **Necessary conditions**:
  - Same number of vertices and edges.
  - Corresponding vertices have the same degree.
  - Preservation of adjacency and non-adjacency.

#### For Data Structures:
- Two data structures (e.g., trees, linked lists, graphs) are isomorphic if they can be transformed into each other by relabeling nodes without changing their connectivity or organization.

### b) Applications of Isomorphism in Computer Science and Engineering

#### 1. Graph Isomorphism in Chemical Informatics

- **Application**: Comparing molecular structures.
- **Scenario**: Chemical compounds are represented as graphs where vertices are atoms and edges are bonds.
- **Use**: Detect if two molecules are identical or have similar structures by checking graph isomorphism.
- **Algorithm**: VF2 Algorithm, Ullmann’s algorithm for graph matching.

#### 2. Pattern Recognition and Image Processing

- **Application**: Matching patterns or shapes that can be represented as graphs.
- **Scenario**: Identify objects in images by matching graph representations of their features.
- **Use**: Object recognition, handwriting analysis.
- **Algorithm**: Subgraph isomorphism algorithms, graph neural networks.

#### 3. Compiler Optimization and Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) Matching

- **Application**: Detecting equivalent code structures.
- **Scenario**: Compilers use ASTs to represent program syntax. Detecting isomorphic subtrees can identify redundant computations or enable code reuse.
- **Use**: Code optimization, refactoring.
- **Algorithm**: Tree isomorphism checks, hashing techniques.

## ✅ Insights

- Isomorphism is critical in identifying equivalences beyond superficial differences.
- It aids in simplifying complex structures, improving efficiency in comparisons.
- The computational complexity of graph isomorphism is still a subject of active research (recent progress: Babai’s quasi-polynomial algorithm).
