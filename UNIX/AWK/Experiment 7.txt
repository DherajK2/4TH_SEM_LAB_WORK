Write an awk script to compute gross salary of an employee accordingly to rule
given below. If basic salary is < 10000 then HRA=15% of basic & DA=45% of
basic If basic salary is >=10000 then HRA=20% of basic & DA=50% of basic.

Sure! Let's walk through a complete solution where:

âœ… We create a simple file (employees.txt) with employee names and basic salaries.

âœ… We write an awk script to calculate Gross Salary based on your rules.

âœ… We explain and show the command to run the script.

âœ… We keep file content short but effective.

âœ… Gross Salary Formula (from your question):
Basic Salary	HRA	DA
< 10000	15% of basic	45% of basic
>= 10000	20% of basic	50% of basic

âœ… Step 1: Create the Folder and Data File
bash
Copy code
mkdir -p awk_demo
cd awk_demo

# Create employees.txt
cat > employees.txt <<EOF
John 9500
Alice 12000
Raj 8500
Nina 10000
EOF
ðŸ“„ employees.txt â€” Sample Input File
yaml
Copy code
John 9500
Alice 12000
Raj 8500
Nina 10000
Each line contains: <Employee_Name> <Basic_Salary>

âœ… Step 2: Write the awk Script
ðŸ”§ Create a file called gross_salary.awk
bash
Copy code
cat > gross_salary.awk <<'EOF'
{
    name = $1
    basic = $2
    if (basic < 10000) {
        hra = 0.15 * basic
        da = 0.45 * basic
    } else {
        hra = 0.20 * basic
        da = 0.50 * basic
    }
    gross = basic + hra + da
    printf "%s\tBasic: %.2f\tGross: %.2f\n", name, basic, gross
}
EOF
âœ… Step 3: Run the Script
bash
Copy code
awk -f gross_salary.awk employees.txt
ðŸ“¤ Output
yaml
Copy code
John	Basic: 9500.00	Gross: 13300.00
Alice	Basic: 12000.00	Gross: 20400.00
Raj	Basic: 8500.00	Gross: 11900.00
Nina	Basic: 10000.00	Gross: 17000.00
âœ… This shows gross salary computed with the correct HRA and DA percentages based on the rules.

âœ… Summary
File	Purpose
employees.txt	Input file with basic salaries
gross_salary.awk	AWK script for gross salary
