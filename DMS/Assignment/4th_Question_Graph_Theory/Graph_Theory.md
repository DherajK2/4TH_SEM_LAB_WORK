## 4) Graph Theory: Definition, Types, and Applications

### a) Definition of a Graph in Graph Theory

A **graph** \( G \) is a structure consisting of:
- **Vertices (V)**: Also known as nodes or points.
- **Edges (E)**: Connections or links between pairs of vertices.

#### Types of Graphs:
- **Directed Graphs**: Edges have a direction (e.g., \( (u, v) \neq (v, u) \)).
- **Undirected Graphs**: Edges have no direction (e.g., \( (u, v) = (v, u) \)).
- **Weighted Graphs**: Edges have values (like cost, time, distance).
- **Unweighted Graphs**: All edges are equal.

#### Formal Representation:
A graph \( G = (V, E) \), where \( V \) is a non-empty set and \( E \) is a set of pairs of elements from \( V \).

### b) Directed vs. Undirected Graphs

#### Directed Graph (Digraph):
- Edges have a direction.
- Used when relationships are one-way.

**Examples**:
- Web hyperlinks
- State transitions in automata
- Task dependencies in scheduling

#### Undirected Graph:
- Edges are bidirectional.
- Used when relationships are mutual.

**Examples**:
- Social network friendships
- Peer-to-peer networks
- Mesh computer networks

### c) Applications of Graph Theory in Computer Science and Engineering

#### 1. Shortest Path Algorithms (Routing and Navigation)

- **Type**: Directed or undirected, weighted
- **Use Case**: GPS systems, transportation networks
- **Algorithms**: Dijkstra’s Algorithm, A\* Search
- **Explanation**: Vertices = locations, Edges = roads with weights representing cost/time.

---

#### 2. Compiler Design and Task Scheduling

- **Type**: Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)
- **Use Case**: Instruction reordering, dependency resolution
- **Algorithm**: Topological Sorting
- **Explanation**: Nodes = tasks, edges = prerequisites; useful in build systems like Make or compilers like GCC.

---

#### 3. Social Network Analysis

- **Type**: Unweighted undirected (or directed for followers)
- **Use Case**: Friend recommendation, community detection
- **Algorithms**: BFS, DFS, Centrality, Girvan-Newman for clustering
- **Explanation**: Analyzes user connections and influence patterns.

---

#### Bonus: Network Security and Attack Graphs

- **Type**: Directed, possibly weighted
- **Use Case**: Visualizing and analyzing attack paths in a network
- **Algorithms**: Graph traversal, cycle detection, graph coloring
- **Explanation**: Helps detect vulnerabilities and simulate attacker strategies.
