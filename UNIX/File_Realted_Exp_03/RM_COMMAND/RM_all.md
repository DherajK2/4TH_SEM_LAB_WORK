# 🗑️ `rm` Command in Linux

The `rm` (remove) command is used to **delete files and directories**. It is a powerful tool — deletions are permanent and do not go to the Recycle Bin.

### `rm` Command:

- **`rm <filename>`**: Removes the specified file.

- **`rm -r <directory>`**: Recursively deletes a directory and all its contents (files and subdirectories).

- **`rm -ri <directory>`**: Recursively deletes a directory, prompting for confirmation before each file is removed. Safer than `-rf`.

- **`rm -f <filename>`**: Forces deletion without prompting, even if the file is write-protected or doesn't exist.

- **`rm -rf <directory>`**: **Forcefully and recursively deletes** a directory and everything inside it without any confirmation.

  ⚠️ **Warning**: This command is powerful and dangerous. It can **permanently delete critical files or directories**, including system files, if used incorrectly. Always double-check the path before using `-rf`.

### ✅ Best Practices:

- Use `-ri` instead of `-rf` when you want to be cautious and avoid accidental deletion.
- When scripting, avoid `rm -rf` unless absolutely necessary and well-tested.
- Consider using `trash` or `mv` to a temporary folder for safer deletions.

## 🛠️ Setup: Create Sample Files and Directories
```bash
mkdir project
cd project

# Create files
touch file1.txt file2.txt

# Create nested directories and files
mkdir dirA dirB
touch dirA/a.txt dirA/b.txt
mkdir dirB/sub
touch dirB/sub/c.txt
```
## 📁 File Structure Before Deletion:
```bash
project/
├── file1.txt
├── file2.txt
├── dirA/
│   ├── a.txt
│   └── b.txt
└── dirB/
    └── sub/
        └── c.txt
```
