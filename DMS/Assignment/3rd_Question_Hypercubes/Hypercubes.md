### a) Use of Hypercube Topologies in Parallel and Distributed Systems

A **hypercube topology** (or n-cube) is a generalization of a cube in multiple dimensions, used in computer systems to represent interconnection networks. An n-dimensional hypercube has \(2^n\) nodes, with each node connected to n others.

#### Key Properties:
- Nodes: \(2^n\)
- Degree: n (connections per node)
- Diameter: n (max hops between nodes)
- Highly symmetric and fault-tolerant

#### Application in Computing:
- Used in **parallel systems** to distribute and process tasks efficiently.
- In **distributed systems**, it provides scalable and fast inter-process communication.
- Example: **Connection Machine CM-2** connected 65,536 processors in a hypercube configuration.

### b) Practical Applications of Hypercube Structures

#### 1. Network Routing in High-Performance Computing
- Reduces communication latency in **data centers** and **supercomputers**.
- Uses binary addressing for minimal-hop routing.
- Examples: IBM Blue Gene/L, Cray supercomputers.

#### 2. Multidimensional Data Processing
- Used in OLAP systems for querying **data cubes** across multiple dimensions.
- Enables fast aggregations and data slicing.
- Example: **SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS)**.

#### 3. Parallel Algorithms and Load Balancing
- Supports distributed computation for tasks like sorting and matrix multiplication.
- Provides efficient communication and load balancing.
- Used in **scientific computing** and **AI training** clusters.
