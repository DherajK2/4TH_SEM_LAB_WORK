## 6) Prefix Codes: Definition, Applications, and Design

### a) Definition and Key Properties of Prefix Codes

A **prefix code** is a set of variable-length codes (codewords) where **no codeword is a prefix of any other codeword**. This property ensures **instantaneous decoding** without ambiguity.

#### Key Properties:
- **Uniquely Decodable**: Each encoded message can be decoded unambiguously.
- **Prefix-Free**: No codeword appears as the beginning segment of another.
- **Variable-Length**: Allows shorter codewords for more frequent symbols, optimizing compression.

#### Example:
Consider codes for symbols A, B, and C:
- A: 0  
- B: 10  
- C: 110  
No code is a prefix of another, so decoding is straightforward.

### b) Applications of Prefix Codes in Computer Science and Engineering

1. **Data Compression (Huffman Coding)**  
   - Widely used in compression formats like ZIP, JPEG.
   - Minimizes average code length by assigning shorter codes to frequent symbols.

2. **Telecommunications and Network Protocols**  
   - Ensures efficient and error-free transmission with fast decoding.

3. **File Systems and Storage**  
   - Used in encoding file metadata and data streams to save space.

4. **Compiler Design (Syntax Parsing)**  
   - Encoding tokens uniquely for parsers and lexical analyzers.

5. **Error Detection and Correction**  
   - Some prefix codes are used in channel coding to reduce error propagation.

### c) Designing a Binary Prefix Code for 6 Messages and Binary Tree Representation

Suppose 6 message types: M1, M2, M3, M4, M5, M6.

A possible prefix code assignment:

| Message | Code  |
|---------|--------|
| M1      | 00     |
| M2      | 01     |
| M3      | 100    |
| M4      | 101    |
| M5      | 110    |
| M6      | 111    |

#### Binary Tree (Prefix Tree) Explanation:

- Root node branches into '0' and '1'.
- Left subtree encodes M1 and M2.
- Right subtree encodes M3, M4, M5, M6.

```bash
        (root)
       /      \
     0          1
   /   \      /   \
 M1    M2  10     11
           / \    / \
         M3  M4  M5  M6
```

#### How the prefix tree aids efficiency:

- **Fast Encoding/Decoding**: Traversing the tree based on bits leads directly to a unique message.
- **No ambiguity**: The prefix property ensures no code overlaps.
- **Space Efficient**: Common prefixes share the same path reducing storage.
- **Scalability**: Easily extended for more messages without redesigning entire code.

## ✅ Insights

Prefix codes are fundamental in encoding schemes that balance compression efficiency with decoding speed, critical in modern computing systems. Their representation as prefix trees elegantly supports quick lookups and error-free transmission.
