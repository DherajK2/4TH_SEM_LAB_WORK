## 2) Recurrence Relations in Recursive Algorithms and Computing Systems

### a) Homogeneous vs. Non-Homogeneous Recurrence Relations

#### Homogeneous Recurrence Relation
A **homogeneous recurrence relation** is a recurrence in which **each term is defined solely in terms of previous terms**, without any additional non-recursive input.

**General Form**:
T(n) = a₁T(n−1) + a₂T(n−2) + ... + aₖT(n−k)

**Example**:
T(n) = 2T(n−1) + T(n−2)

#### Non-Homogeneous Recurrence Relation
A **non-homogeneous recurrence relation** includes **external (non-recursive) terms**, often representing additional cost or input.

**General Form**:
T(n) = a₁T(n−1) + a₂T(n−2) + ... + aₖT(n−k) + f(n)

**Example**:
T(n) = T(n−1) + n

### b) Use in Analyzing Algorithm Complexity

Recurrence relations describe the **time complexity** of recursive algorithms.

#### Examples:

- **Merge Sort**:  
  T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n) → Non-homogeneous → O(n log n)

- **Binary Search**:  
  T(n) = T(n/2) + O(1) → Non-homogeneous → O(log n)

- **Fibonacci (naïve)**:  
  T(n) = T(n−1) + T(n−2) → Homogeneous → O(2ⁿ)

Solving these helps determine Big-O complexity.

### c) Applications of Homogeneous and Non-Homogeneous Recurrences

#### ✅ Homogeneous Recurrence Applications

1. **Fibonacci Sequence (Algorithm Design & Optimization)**  
   - Scenario: Dynamic programming and sequence modeling in bioinformatics.

2. **Divide-and-Conquer Algorithms without Overhead**  
   - Example: Karatsuba multiplication  
   - Scenario: Used in cryptography, fast multiplication.

#### ✅ Non-Homogeneous Recurrence Applications

1. **Merge Sort / Quick Sort Analysis**  
   - Scenario: Recursive division with additional combining cost (e.g., merging arrays).

2. **Memory Access Cost Modeling in Cache Systems**  
   - Scenario: Recursion with I/O or latency cost per call level (e.g., cloud-based systems).
