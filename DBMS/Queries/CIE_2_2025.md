# CIE SQL Questions and Answers

## Given Relational Schema

- **STUDENT(StudentID, StudentName, Department)**
- **COURSE(CourseID, CourseName, Department)**
- **ENROLLMENT(StudentID, CourseID, Grade)**
- **FACULTY(FacultyID, FacultyName, Department)**
- **TEACHES(FacultyID, CourseID)**

---

### i) List all students along with the names of the courses they are enrolled in.

```sql
SELECT S.StudentName, C.CourseName
FROM STUDENT S
JOIN ENROLLMENT E ON S.StudentID = E.StudentID
JOIN COURSE C ON E.CourseID = C.CourseID;
```
#### Alternate
```sql
SELECT S.StudentName, C.CourseName  
FROM STUDENT S, ENROLLMENT E, COURSE C 
WHERE S.StudentID = E.StudentID 
 AND E.CourseID = C.CourseID;
```
---

### ii) Retrieve names of students who are not enrolled in any course.
```sql
SELECT StudentName
FROM STUDENT
WHERE StudentID NOT IN (
    SELECT StudentID
    FROM ENROLLMENT );
```
#### Alternate 1
```sql
SELECT S.StudentName
FROM STUDENT S
LEFT JOIN ENROLLMENT E ON S.StudentID = E.StudentID
WHERE E.CourseID IS NULL;
```

#### Alternate 2
```sql
SELECT StudentName
FROM STUDENT
MINUS
SELECT S.StudentName
FROM STUDENT S
JOIN ENROLLMENT E ON S.StudentID = E.StudentID;
```
---
### iii) List the departments along with the number of courses they offer.
```sql
SELECT Department, COUNT(*) AS NumberOfCourses
FROM COURSE
GROUP BY Department;
```

---
### iv) Find the names of students who have enrolled in more than 3 courses.
```sql
SELECT S.StudentName
FROM STUDENT S
JOIN ENROLLMENT E ON S.StudentID = E.StudentID
GROUP BY S.StudentID, S.StudentName
HAVING COUNT(E.CourseID) > 3;

```
### v) Find the course with the highest number of enrollments.
```sql
SELECT C.CourseName
FROM COURSE C
JOIN ENROLLMENT E ON C.CourseID = E.CourseID
GROUP BY C.CourseID, C.CourseName
ORDER BY COUNT(E.StudentID) DESC
LIMIT 1;

```
---

# Question 2 – SQL View and Trigger

---

### (i) Create a view that shows each student’s name, the course they are enrolled in, and the corresponding grade. [2M]

```sql
CREATE VIEW StudentCourseGrades AS
SELECT S.StudentName, C.CourseName, E.Grade
FROM STUDENT S, ENROLLMENT E, COURSE C
WHERE S.StudentID = E.StudentID AND E.CourseID = C.CourseID;
```

- **LogID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT**
- **StudentID INT**
- **ENROLLMENT(StudentID, CourseID, Grade)**
- **Date DATE**

```sql
DELIMITER $$

CREATE TRIGGER t_LogEnrollment
AFTER INSERT ON ENROLLMENT
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO Enrollment_Log (StudentID, CourseID, Date)
    VALUES (NEW.StudentID, NEW.CourseID, CURDATE());
END$$

DELIMITER ;
```
